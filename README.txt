Project introduction
-
For my final project I developed an AI chess game, using the  popular technique, the alpha-beta algorithm.

This algorithm is an expansion to the minimax algorithm, and allows the computers to work out the optimal next move, in an efficient fashion.

Technologies used
-
The game was developed using the java programming language.

How to launch program
-
To launch the program, an executable file can be launched. (ChessPieces.png required in the same folder)

The executable file can be located - FinalProject/out/artifacts/ExecutableFile.jar

Additional information
